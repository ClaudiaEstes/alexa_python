		Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit 's' on your keyboard).

### Developing a skill requires

* Amazon Developer Account
* Amazon Console Account
 * Or some way to deploy web service
* Alexa enabled device (e.g. a Dot)
 * Can be Reverb on Phone


---

### So, a Developer gets a Dot

#### Alexa/Amazon overview
---
* ASK (Skills Kit) and AVS (Voice Service)
* Echo, Tap, Dot
* [Developer.amazon.com](developer.amazon.com)
* [AWS.amazon.com](aws.amazon.com)


--

---


### Intents and Utterances

* Go to Developer account, Alexa tab, ASK
* Create a skill (Small Business site - ACME, Inc.)
* Invocation Name


--


<img src="images/ask.jpeg" />


--


<img src="images/skills.jpeg" />


--

* Must Define your "intents"
* Define "utterances" that are the phrases to match to intents
* Alexa, ask [or tell] {invocation name} [for] {intent}
* Alexa, ask 'Small Biz' for General Information


--

---


### Provide a service
---
* Yes, finally getting to the serverless part
* You can create your own web service to handle the ASK JSON request/response
* But, the point for my talk is to use this as an opportunity to try lambda services
* Go ahead and get started doing things manually


---


### Point to the service
---
* Now, that you have a service, go back to the developer tab
* Copy in the ARN for your lambda


---


### Test
---
#### Three ways to test


--


* From the developer Console
 * Can examine the JSON in and out!


--


* From the AWS lambda console
 * You'll likely end up there anyway if your skill fails
 * Examine cloud watch logs (simple errors prevent any JSON sent back)
 * Either use the test config Alexa JSON or use the input JSON from developer


--


* From your device
 * Your skill is immediately available to your account
 * If you don't have a device, use reverb or [echoism.io](https://echoism.io)




---


### Basic Example, "Tech Em"

Copy and paste



---


### Enhanced teaching Example

deploy


---


### Persist some data

s3


--


diagram


---


### Bump up to a db

dynamo


---


### Build a Service

for API Gateway



---


### Deploy Together


---


### As projects get bigger

* Can separate CRUD Service
* Reuse API access layer


--


diagram


---


## And Wait!
### What about Node/JS?
### What about Serverless.com
---
* Have focused on Alexa, Py and Travis
 * Yes, a bit manual/clear box
* So, Check out serverless.com
* Very easily deploy Node lambda
* And deploy API GW (endpoint)


--


* Can also deploy python code with serverless
* There are many ways to enjoy your cookie, e.g.:
 * Deploy to Alexa lambda and pypi via Travis
 * Reuse pypi module via serverless for API
* If you get serious, try out your own (and let me know)
* And don't forget the testing!!
